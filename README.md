# Customer Interface for Scooter Sharing Application

This application is part of a larger development project in the course "pattern" at BTH.

React was used to build the application, and it is part of a complete full-stack scooter sharing application. The system consists of a backend build with express.js (and MongoDB) and three front-end applications. The application is one of these three, and it functions as the customer's administrative interface. It allows users to log in with Google OAuth to review their travel history and change/add payment information and city.
